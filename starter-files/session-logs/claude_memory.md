# Claude Memory - Sample Session Log

*A chronological record of development thoughts and changes for maintaining continuity across sessions*

## 2025-07-23 17:25:00 - Cohere Project Initialization
Created new Cohere project for LangChain-based auto-regen website. Core concept: pull content from Claude session logs and create intelligent aggregations of progress/failures, not just commit summaries.

## 2025-07-23 17:26:00 - GitHub Pages Setup  
Successfully created dev-journey repository at https://captrainwalrus.github.io/dev-journey. Configured GitHub Pages to serve from /docs folder. Ready to populate with auto-generated content from session logs.

## 2025-07-23 17:27:00 - LangChain Integration Architecture
Designed comprehensive workflow: GitHub Actions trigger on session log commits → LangChain processes content → HTML generator creates website → GitHub Pages deploys. Added context tagging system to automatically categorize entries by project.

## 2025-07-23 17:28:00 - Context Tagging Implementation
Implemented intelligent context tagger that identifies project contexts (NinjaTrader, FluidJournal, Cohere, VectorBT, Infrastructure) based on keywords and patterns. Each session entry gets automatically tagged for better organization and insights.

## 2025-07-23 17:29:00 - Enhanced Website Template
Created modern responsive website template with project context visualization. Features color-coded tags, insight extraction, dark mode support, and statistical dashboards. Shows development journey narratively rather than as raw logs.

## 2025-07-23 17:30:00 - Testing Infrastructure Ready
All starter files created and ready for deployment. Repository structure includes session-logs/, src/processing/, src/templates/, and GitHub Actions workflow. Next step: commit files to dev-journey repo and test auto-generation.
