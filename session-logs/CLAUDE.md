# Trading System Workspace Overview

This workspace contains a sophisticated algorithmic trading system with NinjaTrader 8 integration and multiple backend microservices.

## Current Session Model
- **Model**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Updated**: 2025-07-15
- **Fixed**: Windows compatibility for startup menus (storage-menu.js, risk-menu.js)

## Critical LanceDB Behavior
- **Schema Initialization**: When storage agent starts with 0 vectors, must create a blank/dummy record
- **Requirement**: One row must exist in LanceDB table before additional records can be stored
- **Current Implementation**: Creates SCHEMA_INIT record, then deletes it after schema setup
- **Potential Issue**: May need to keep dummy record instead of deleting it

## Critical Trade Storage Issue (2025-07-15)
- **Problem**: Trade classifier marking all trades as "Too low importance (0%)"
- **Result**: All trades being skipped with message "üóëÔ∏è SKIPPED: [ID] - Too low importance (0%)"
- **Impact**: No trade data being stored despite valid payloads from NinjaTrader
- **Debug Data**: Shows valid features (74 count), outcomes (PnL: 45), but shouldStore: false
- **Fix Needed**: Investigate trade classifier logic or set FORCE_STORE_ALL flag

## GP Training Data Issues (2025-07-15)
- **Issue 1**: GP trainer expects specific filename format (e.g., "MGC_long_training.json")
- **Issue 2**: Data format mismatch - trainer expects structured format vs array of records
- **Issue 3**: Filename normalization - "MGC AUG25" vs "MGC"
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ Updated export to create properly named files by instrument+direction
  - ‚úÖ Added convertToGPFormat() to transform Storage Agent data to GP trainer format
  - ‚úÖ Added normalizeInstrumentName() to strip contract suffixes (AUG25, SEP25, etc.)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed Windows ENOBUFS with Node.js HTTP instead of curl
- **Current Status**: Export works, files created with correct format and names

## Important Considerations

### Working with the Codebase
1. **Test File Clutter**: Each service directory contains numerous test files, debug scripts, and experimental code. Focus on:
   - `server.js` or `index.js` as entry points
   - `src/` directories for core logic
   - Ignore `test/`, `debug/`, `experimental/` folders initially

2. **Configuration**: Services use environment variables extensively. Look for:
   - `.env` files (if present)
   - Environment variable documentation in service README files
   - Default configurations in service entry files

3. **Data Flow Priority**:
   ```
   Market Data ‚Üí MI Service ‚Üí ME/RF Services ‚Üí Signal Pool ‚Üí NinjaTrader
   ```

## Strategic Evolution: RF ‚Üí Agentic Memory System

### Historical Context: RF Meta-Labeling Pipeline (IMPLEMENTED)
Previously implemented complete meta-labeling approach where traditional strategies provide the "edge" and ML models enhance signal filtering. This addressed the poor performance (~10% accuracy) of pure pattern discovery approaches.

**Previous Architecture Flow:**
```
Traditional Strategy ‚Üí BuildNewSignal() ‚Üí RF Filter (Optional) ‚Üí Signal Approval Service ‚Üí Entry/Exit ‚Üí Training Data Export
```

### Current Direction: Agentic Memory System (IMPLEMENTED)
Successfully transitioned from static RF models to adaptive agentic memory that learns optimal risk parameters from historical patterns using graduated feature matching.

**Implemented Architecture Flow:**
```
NT ‚Üí MI (bars) ‚Üí ME (94+ features) ‚Üí Risk Agent (graduated features) ‚Üí Storage Agent
                                   ‚Üì
Position Exit ‚Üí ME ‚Üí Storage (full 94 features) ‚Üí LanceDB ‚Üí Graduated Similarity ‚Üí Risk Decisions
```

- ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL**: Predictive range intelligence with bar time-based updates
- üéØ **BREAKTHROUGH**: Range-based confidence scoring instead of similarity matching

### Major Implementation Milestone (2025-07-13)

#### Range-Based Intelligence Revolution
**SOLVED THE CORE PROBLEM**: Transformed from meaningless similarity matching to predictive range intelligence:

**Old Similarity Approach (FAILED)**:
- Compare feature vectors for "similarity"
- 99.9% similarity but random outcomes
- Constant features create false matches
- No understanding of what leads to profits

**New Range-Based Approach (REVOLUTIONARY)**:
- **Optimal ranges** from profitable trades (Q25-Q75)
- **Acceptable ranges** from profitable trades (P10-P90)
- **Confidence scoring** based on how query fits ranges
- **Signal direction** understanding (higher/lower is better)

**Example Range Analysis**:
```
Query: atr_percentage = 0.2 (from NinjaTrader)
MGC Long Optimal Range: 0.019 - 0.034  
Result: POOR confidence (10%) - 6-10x higher than profitable range!
Action: Correctly rejects high-volatility conditions
```

#### Intelligent Range-Based Graduation
**Profitable trade analysis** replaces similarity:
- **Range Calculation**: Q25-Q75 for optimal, P10-P90 for acceptable
- **Signal Direction**: Compare profitable vs unprofitable means
- **Bar Time Updates**: Every 30 minutes based on actual trade timestamps
- **Contract Normalization**: MGC tables work across all MGC contracts
- **Statistical Significance**: Requires minimum data for reliable ranges

#### Revolutionary Confidence System
**Range-based confidence scoring**:
- **OPTIMAL** (0.8-1.0): Query within Q25-Q75 of profitable trades
- **ACCEPTABLE** (0.4-0.8): Query within P10-P90 of profitable trades  
- **POOR** (0.1-0.4): Query outside acceptable ranges
- **Rejection Logic**: 3+ poor features = reject trade
- **Market Intelligence**: Knows MGC long prefers low volatility

#### Critical Discovery: What MGC Long Profits Require
- **Low volatility** (atr_percentage: 0.019-0.034 vs 0.2 query)
- **Calm markets** (atr_14: 0.544-0.938 vs 5.5 query)
- **No inside bars** (inside_bar = 0 preferred)
- **Normal price efficiency** (high_low_ratio: 1.0002-1.0008)

- **2025-07-17**: **CRITICAL FIX** - Normalized all PnL calculations to per-contract values

## Critical Implementation Details

### Position Size Normalization (2025-07-17)
**CRITICAL**: All PnL calculations must use normalized per-contract values:
- **Storage**: Stores both `pnl` (raw) and `pnlPerContract` (normalized)
- **Risk Calculations**: Use `pnlPerContract || pnl` pattern for backward compatibility
- **Pattern Matching**: Compare trades fairly regardless of position size
- **Graduation Tables**: Separate profitable/unprofitable using per-contract values
- **Heat Maps**: Filter patterns based on normalized thresholds

### Key Code Patterns
```javascript
// Always use this pattern for PnL access:
const normalizedPnl = pattern.pnlPerContract || pattern.pnl || 0;

// For filtering profitable trades:
const profitable = vectors.filter(v => (v.pnlPerContract || v.pnl) > 0);

// For loss calculations:
const avgLoss = patterns.reduce((sum, p) => sum + Math.abs(p.pnlPerContract || p.pnl || 0), 0) / patterns.length;
```
